# Smart-Traffic-light-controller
# Introduction :
* Traffic management is a crucial aspect of urban infrastructure, and automation plays a significant role in improving efficiency and safety. This project focuses on designing a Smart Traffic Light System using an Arduino Uno, which simulates a real-world traffic signal with an added pedestrian crossing feature.
The system consists of three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) representing standard traffic signals and a push button that allows pedestrians to request a safe crossing. When the button is pressed, the traffic light immediately turns Red to stop vehicles and allow pedestrians to cross safely. After a brief delay, the system resumes its normal Green → Yellow → Red cycle.

# Features:
*✅ Realistic Traffic Light Cycle – The system follows a standard Green → Yellow → Red → Green sequence, simulating real-world traffic signals.

✅ Pedestrian Crossing Mechanism – A push button allows pedestrians to request a safe crossing by immediately turning the light Red.

✅ Automatic Return to Normal Operation – After the pedestrian phase, the system resumes its normal traffic light cycle automatically.

✅ Debounced Button Input – Ensures accurate detection of pedestrian requests, preventing false triggers due to button noise.

✅ Efficient and Cost-Effective – Uses basic electronic components like LEDs, resistors, and an Arduino Uno, making it an affordable and scalable solution.

✅ Ideal for Beginners and Learning – Provides hands-on experience with Arduino programming, input/output control, and real-world automation concepts.
